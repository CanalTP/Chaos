    Scenario: we cannot create severity without client
        When I post to "/severities" with:
        """
        {"wordings": [{"key": "test", "value": "foo"}]}
        """
        Then the status code should be "400"

    Scenario: wordings is required
        I fill in header "X-Customer-Id" with "5"
        When I post to "/severities"
        Then the status code should be "400"
