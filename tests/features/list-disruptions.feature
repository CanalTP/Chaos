Feature: list disruptions

    Scenario: if there is no disruption the list is empty
        When I get "/disruptions"
        Then the status code should be "200"
        And the header "Content-Type" should be "application/json"
        and "disruptions" should be empty

    Scenario: list of two disruptions

        Given I have the following causes in my database:
