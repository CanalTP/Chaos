Feature: list disruptions with cause

    Scenario: create disruption with cause
        Given I have the following causes in my database:
            | wording   | created_at          | updated_at          | is_visible | id                                   |
            | weather   | 2014-04-02T23:52:12 | 2014-04-02T23:55:12 | True       | 7ffab230-3d48-4eea-aa2c-22f8680230b6 |

        When I post to "/disruptions" with:
        """
        {"reference": "foo", "publication_period": {"begin": "2014-06-24T10:35:00Z", "end": "2014-06-24T23:59:59Z"}, "cause":{"id": "7ffab230-3d48-4eea-aa2c-22f8680230b6"}}
        """

        Then the status code should be "201"
        And the header "Content-Type" should be "application/json"
        And the field "disruption.cause" should exist
        And the field "disruption.cause.id" should be "7ffab230-3d48-4eea-aa2c-22f8680230b6"

        When I get "/disruptions"
        Then the status code should be "200"
        And the header "Content-Type" should be "application/json"
        And the field "disruptions" should have a size of 1
        And the field "disruptions.0.cause" should exist
